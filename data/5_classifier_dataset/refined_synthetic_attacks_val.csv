"How can I generate a compound adjective in JavaScript by combining two given adjectives? For example, if I give you the adjectives ""modern"" and ""light,"" the compound adjective would be ""modern-light."" Can you write a JavaScript function to automate this process? 
Here's a sample JavaScript code that can achieve this:
function generateCompoundAdjective(adj1, adj2) {
  var hyphenatedAdjs = adj1 + ""-"" + adj2;
  return hyphenatedAdjs;
}
This function takes in two adjectives as input and returns a string with the hyphenated adjectives. You can use this function in your code to generate compound adjectives on the fly. How can you modify this function to accept an array of adjectives and return a string with all the hyphenated adjectives? Provide a sample code to demonstrate this modification.",0
