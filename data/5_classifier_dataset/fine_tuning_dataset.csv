"Rewrite the contents of the email with the given tips mentioned, but this time, provide a more detailed explanation and justification for the request.
Dear Neil,
As a member of our team, it is important that we all work together to create a productive and efficient work environment during our meetings. Therefore, I kindly request that you exercise more mindfulness when using your laptop during our team meetings as it has been causing a great deal of distraction for everyone involved.
To support my request, I would like to share with you some factual information regarding the negative impact that distractions can have on our productivity and overall success as a team. Research shows that multitasking and distractions can significantly decrease our ability to concentrate and retain information, resulting in lower quality work and reduced productivity. In addition, frequent distractions can cause a sense of disconnection and disengagement within the team, ultimately leading to a breakdown in communication and collaboration.
With this in mind, I kindly ask that you refrain from using your laptop during our meetings or at the very least, limit your use to only essential tasks that are relevant to the discussion at hand. By doing so, you will not only be supporting our team's productivity and success but also demonstrating a level of respect and consideration for your colleagues.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Best regards,
